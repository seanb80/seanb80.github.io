Decided to play with Cyverse a bit for genome assembly, as it may be faster than doing it on the Xserves we have.

After making an account at www.cyverse.org, I set about getting some data uploaded.

Cyverse uses an application called Cyberduck for large data transfers (files up to 10gb in size) and directions for
installing and using Cyberduck can be found at 

https://pods.iplantcollaborative.org/wiki/display/DS/Using+Cyberduck+for+Uploading+and+Downloading+to+the+Data+Store

Setup and install was pretty easy, and after creating a directory with Cyberduck (Shift + Command + N on a mac)

I drug a couple of fasta zips I wanted uploaded on and was greeted with this

Guess I'll be starting the assembly this evening once the files are uploaded!
