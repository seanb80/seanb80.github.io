After Lab meeting, we came up with some stuff for me to look at

1. Look at Different pair combinations of Day 0 (1 and 2 vs 3 and 4, etc).
2. Build co-variate files for Day 10, Day 135, and Day 145
    Day 10 includes Treatment and Relatedness
    Day 135 includes Treatment, Relatedness, and Time
    Day 145 includes relatedness, initial ph, secondary ph

3. run qvalue (from bioconductor) on the Day 10 and Day 135 results I already have

4. email Amanda (the lead author for the MACAU) paper to ask questions regarding reproduciblity.
