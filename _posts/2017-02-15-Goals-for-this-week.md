New week means new goals! Had a good conversation with Hollie and have a good idea for a direction to head with the Geoduck analysis.

Here are my things to do.

1. Organize `/scaphapoda/Sean` such that it makes sense to people other than myself. 
2. Finish Day 145 MACAU runs 
3. Figure out a good way to determine K for K-means clustering (BIC, Variance Scree plot, silhouette plot, etc)
4. Look at a combined Day 10 and Day 135 MACAU run, Initially with treatment as the predictor variable, but if that doesn't produce meaningful results, try Time as the predictor
5. Think about automatic annotation for when we get a new, fancier genome.
6. Decide how we want to visualize this in the end. Maybe heat maps, or something better.
