Talked with Hollie and Steven today, and here's where I'm going for now with the Geoduck RRBS data

-Find Means/Variance of methylation proportion for DMRs by treatment.
-Classify the 41 DMRs by treatment, and location. Will likely try to do this both by mean, and with all samples represented, since there are so few.
-Experiment with less stringent filtering, 
-Run Day 135 similarly to Day 10.
-Look for post-hoc tests for beta-binomial mixed effects model. My Statistical Methods in Biology book is going to get a workout for this.
