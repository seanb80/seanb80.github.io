Today I started working on identifying transposable elements in the Ostrea lurida genome via RepeatMasker.

RepeatMasker is a linux based program that identifies transposable elements, satellites, and regions of 
low DNA complexity from an existing .FASTA file. The program can be found at http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html
