Today we got some new Hobo temperature loggers (Water Temp Pro V2) for logging out at Manchester. I took a few minutes to get them prepped for deployment, and all on the same clock so they log at the same

These looked just like the other Hobo loggers we had, except at some point in time OnSet added a ridge to the side to clock them so they always orient to the sensor correctly. Normally this would be convenient, but our shuttle adaptor didn't have the corresponding notch, so they didn't mate properly.

No problem! A quick trip over to the SAFS shop remedied that. Super classy, I know.

After downloading the Hoboware application from http://www.onsetcomp.com/hoboware-trial-download and putting the Roberts Lab key in, everything looked good! The free version won't interface with the larger V2 probes, so the pro version is required

I then hooked up just the shuttle, to sync the time with my system clock, ensuring it passes the correct time on to the pendants when lauching them. This is done by clicking the Sync Shuttle Clock button.

Then I plugged a pendant in to the shuttle and set it up. I checked to make sure the pendant serial number matched what the screen was showing.

Then I set the logging interval to 30 minutes, and set a delayed start time so all of the pendants would start logging at the same time.

Setting up the loggers is as simple as that!
